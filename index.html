			<p style="font-size: 36px; color: white;"> Juice Tape <br> Experimental Video Edit, 1280x720 <br>I have always had a strong passion for playing video games and listening to music. That being said, I wanted to use my artistic craft to combine these passions of mine into a visual work of art  
			can change the way I experience both of these things. I took my own gaming clips from NBA 2K and synced them to a song I enjoy listening to. This song of choice was one from one of my favorite rappers who had passed away shortly before the creation of 
				this video, so I made this as a way of paying homage to him. I then added effects that I believed to follow the flow and mood of the song. That is
				how I ended up with this new video that is similar to highlight tapes that basketball players have to showcase their skills.
