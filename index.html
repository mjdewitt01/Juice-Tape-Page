			<p style="font-size: 36px; color: white;"> I have always enjoyed playing video games and love listening to music. That being said, I wanted to use my artistic craft to combine these passions of mine in a visual work of art  
			can change the way I experience both of these things. I took my own gaming clips from NBA 2K and synced them to a song i enjoy listening to. I then added in effects that I believe follow the flow and mood of the song and that is
				how I ended up with this new video that is similar to a highlight tape that basketball players have.
